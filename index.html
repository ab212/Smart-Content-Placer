    <h1>Smart Content / Image Placer</h1>
    <p><strong>Resize this page!</strong> I have created a small component to programmatically position difficult content. What do I mean by that? Well lets assume you have many images which are different widths and heights. How do you fit them on a page such that there are no "gaps"? Using just CSS this is a no go. Imagine Pinterest on steroids Pinterest only allows for variable height), this little component allows for variable width and height content! Enjoy :-) Give me a shoutout if you use it, would love to see!</p>
