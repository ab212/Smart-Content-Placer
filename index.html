    <h1>Smart Content / Image Placer</h1>
    <p id="intro1"><strong>5 seconds after this page loads</strong> we shall change the margin to 1px and the base unit size to 200px.</p>
    <p id="intro2" class="hide"><strong>In another 5 seconds</strong> we shall simulate updating the component with new data (e.g. from some API) and change the draw speed.</p>
    <p id="intro3" class="hide"><strong>Cool huh? Now resize this page!</strong></p>
    <p>I have created a small component to programmatically position difficult content. What do I mean by that? Well lets assume you have many images which are different widths and heights. How do you fit them on a page such that there are no "gaps"? Using just CSS this is a no go. Imagine Pinterest on steroids Pinterest only allows for variable height), this little component allows for variable width and height content! Enjoy :-) Give me a shoutout if you use it, would love to see!</p>
