Smart-Content-Placer
====================

A small class to programmatically position difficult content. What do I mean by that? Well lets assume you have many images which are different widths and heights. How do you fit them on a page such that there are no "gaps"? This is basically a constrained bin packing problem. Using just CSS this is a no go. Imagine Pinterest on steroids (Pinterest only allows for variable height), this little component allows for variable width and height content!
